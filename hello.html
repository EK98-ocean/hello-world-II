<h1>Practice file</h1>
<p>This is the second file I am making, just to make sure I completely understand the Git process. I intend to create a local Git repository, then create a remote Git repository on GitHub and push my local repository to the remote one.</p>
<h2>Progress check</h2>
<p>I have created a local Git repository, I will now create my first commit. To do this, I first save this file and the changes I have made, then add it to the staging area on Terminal. Following that, I will make my first commit, following the format for a comment "This commit will..." I will edit this document once the first commit is complete.</p>
<h2>Progress check</h2>
<p>I have made my first commit to my local repository. I will now create a remote repository on GitHub online, link my local repository to that remote repository, and make a further commit, to both my local and remote repositories.</p>
